# Solution:
8

# Explenation:
JUMP uses a stack paremeter to alter a program counter. Destination is loaded from stack.
On this case we firstly load sended ETH and then program jumps to counter equal our sended ETH

# Code:
```
00      34      CALLVALUE
01      56      JUMP
02      FD      REVERT
03      FD      REVERT
04      FD      REVERT
05      FD      REVERT
06      FD      REVERT
07      FD      REVERT
08      5B      JUMPDEST // to pass we need to go here!
09      00      STOP
```
